        <h2>A quick, easy and delicious smash burger, homemade in minutes.</h2>
        <p>Smash burgers are formed into balls of ground beef then pressed or smashed with a burger press into a thin patty 
            as soon as they hit the grill. This creates extra browning and flavor on the outside while maintaining the 
            patty's juiciness.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ground beef (the fattier the meat, the juicier the burger)</li>
                <li>Sauce. A simple sauce made with mayo, mustard, onions and pickles</li>
                <li>Brioche buns</li>
                <li>Sliced cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>Toppings. Pickles, onion, lettuce and tomato</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare patties. Form 2 quarter pounder balls</li>
                <li>Combine mayo, mustard, onions and pickles to make your sauce</li>
                <li>Slice lettuce, onions, pickles and tomatoes ready to assemble just before your patties are done</li>
                <li>Toast and butter buns</li>
                <li>Heat a little oil over medium and once hot place your beef balls into the pan and smash each ball
                    into a thin patty using a spatula. Sear for 2 minutes then flip and place cheese slice onto cooked patty
                    cooking for a further minute</li>
                <li>Stack both patties on top of each other and add to toasted bun. Finally add lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles</li>
                <li>Wolf down</li>
