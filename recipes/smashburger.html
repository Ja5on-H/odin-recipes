        <h2>A quick, easy and delicious smash burger, homemade in minutes</h2>
        <p>Smash burgers start life as balls of ground beef. As soon as they hit the grill they're pressed or smashed with a spatula to form a thin 
            patty. This creates extra browning and flavour on the outside while remaining juicy on the inside.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ground beef (the fattier the meat, the juicier the burger)</li>
                <li>A simple sauce made with mayo, mustard, onions and pickles</li>
                <li>Brioche buns</li>
                <li>Sliced cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>Pickles, onion, lettuce and tomato to top the patties</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare patties. Form 2 114g balls</li>
                <li>Combine mayo, mustard, onions and pickles to make your sauce</li>
                <li>Slice lettuce, onions, pickles and tomatoes ready to assemble just before your patties are done</li>
                <li>Toast and butter buns</li>
                <li>Heat a little oil over medium and once hot place your beef balls into the pan and smash each ball
                    into a thin patty using a spatula. Sear for 2 minutes then flip and place cheese slice on top. 
                    Cook for a further minute</li>
                <li>Let's construct our burger. Add lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pickles to our liberally sauced buns. 
                    Stack both patties on top of each other and add top bun</li>
                <li>Wolf down</li>
            </ol>
